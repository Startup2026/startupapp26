🚀 7️⃣ Student Safety Mode

If startup:

Asks for money

Requests personal data

Suspicious activity

1-click report → instant internal freeze.

Platform auto-investigates.

No portal is aggressive on student protection.


The "Anti-Ghosting" Guarantee
The biggest pain point in job hunting is silence.

The Concept: Companies are rated on their response time. * The USP: If a company doesn't respond to an application within 7 days, the listing is automatically hidden or the company loses "Recruiter Credits."

Transparency: Candidates see a "Probability of Response" score before they even click apply.

✅ Simple Time-Based Recovery Rule

Instead of complicated logic, use this:

🟢 Rule:

Every 30 days →
If:

❌ No negative actions

✅ At least 1 interview attended

→ +5 points

That’s it. Fixed value. Not 5–10. Just +5.

Simple = predictable.
